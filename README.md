# Data Persistence Project

A Unity-based project showcasing data persistence techniques between scenes and sessions. The game includes the following features:

- Main Menu: Players can enter their name with the maximum of three letters and start the game.
- Main Game: A breakout-style game where the current score and the highest score are displayed during gameplay.
- Leaderboard Screen: Displays the top 5 players with the highest scores.

This project was developed as part of Unityâ€™s Junior Programmer pathway to demonstrate scene flow management, object-oriented principles, and data persistence implementation.
